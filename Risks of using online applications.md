# Risks of using online applications

There are many free applications available on the Internet, and there is almost no situation in life for which an ‘app’ has not been written that cannot solve the given problem. And while you may not realise it, there are many examples of free software and apps you use regularly.

But how well do you know that these apps are safe? What should you pay attention to before downloading them? What could be the signs that you should beware of downloading them? This document seeks answers to such and similar questions and tries to help.

Free apps often offer more benefits than paid versions but have significant risks. What are these risks, and how can you stay safe? While the word ‘free’ can be tempting, knowing the product before downloading anything is essential.

## 1. Online or offline?

We can undoubtedly say that everything is available online today, and many products are free, which is often helpful and a convenient solution.

If you are looking for a word or phrase in a specific target language, you would type it into Google Translate rather than take the dictionary off the shelf. In our fast-paced world, this is almost self-evident, not only because we have become comfortable but also because we have the answer almost in seconds, and we do not have to make a special effort to solve the problem.

However, when using software online, you should remember that it is like working remotely on someone else’s computer. There are many online PDF-Word converters on the Internet, which are free and have their limitations in terms of functionality. Sometimes they only work in the free version up to a particular file size. 

Other times they do not know how to recognise characters. In the latter case, it does not make much sense to use them: by saving the PDF as an image and pasting it into a Word document, the result is often unusable.

However, these problems are more of an inconvenience than a danger. The more dangerous situation is that these online programs and the companies that provide them can access your data (with which you registered for free usage) and the content you create with these applications. You cannot influence who else has access to a letter, table, message, or picture you created with a free app, what they do with the information contained in it, and what they use it for.

Suppose you want to convert a publicly available PDF file into Word format. There is no major problem in that case since the data you upload to the cloud for conversion already exists elsewhere. If, on the other hand, you were to do the same with personal or company data encrypted online, it would raise many privacy-related questions.

## 2. Are free apps really free?

If I had to answer the question briefly, I would say no: applications marketed as ‘free’ have a different price tag and try to make a profit differently. One of the most common monetisation strategies free apps use is collecting and selling their users’ personal data to third parties.

We live in a digital age in which data is valued and often considered more valuable than anything else in the fierce competition for customers.

It is no wonder that many companies are willing to pay huge sums to acquire customer data and their personal preferences. After all, even if they do not want to abuse them, they could forge a competitive advantage by contacting the customers they acquired with targeted ads and selling their products or services (and thus making a profit). 

## 3. Why can free apps be dangerous?

Aside from potentially unethical data management practices, there are other downsides of using free apps that can be even more dangerous. So what are the most common app security issues?

### 3.1. They may contain malware and spyware

Free apps can contain malware designed to infect your computer and gain access to personal data (which can also be achieved by malicious actors taking control of a device remotely). This hidden malware can hack your phone or PC and steal your sensitive data, like bank logins and passwords.

Free applications can have serious security flaws and vulnerabilities, so they should always be treated cautiously. When using free applications, there is no guarantee for the user’s safety since everyone downloads the application at their own risk (you consent or agree to this when downloading). At the same time, free apps can contain malware and spyware that can steal personal data from you without your knowledge.

### 3.2. They may be used as Trojan horses

Trojans are malicious applications bundled with other applications or use spoofing or phishing tactics to convince users that they are legitimate software. One of the main dangers of free apps is that they can be used as trojans to install other free apps. As a result, you can install malicious programs on your machine without your will and knowledge. Once downloaded, the Trojan gains system access and control over your device, causing data loss, corruption, or modification.

### 3.3. They may steal private information

Free apps can capture your email address, phone number, credit card number, and any other personal information or passwords stored on your computer or smartphone.
Unfortunately, free apps allow access to sensitive data over the Internet, increasing the risk of free apps and malware theft.

### 3.4. They may infect you with adware

With free programs, you can very often download advertising programs, which often run unnoticed in the background and use your computer’s resources, increase its vulnerability and can open a backdoor for other unwanted programs. Advertising programs running on your machine increase your data traffic, accelerates battery drain, and can even lead to overheating of the device.

### 3.5. They may have security holes and broken cryptography

Encryption has become essential in protecting sensitive data. In the case of free applications, it may happen that their developers do not use the most advanced algorithms or do not fix the security holes they become aware of over time (it may happen that the application is not under continuous development, the development team has ceased to exist, so continuous release cycles do not work and errors are not corrected).

This situation makes it much easier for hackers to crack passwords and gain access to confidential data. On the other hand, it is improbable that companies developing paid applications would leave security holes unnoticed or not try to fix them as soon as possible. Companies that develop paid apps usually use high encryption standards to prevent potential security issues with their code. 

The life situation is also wholly different since, in the case of a paid application, the user can rightfully expect certain things from the company and its product (among other things, that they also pay great attention to the protection of their personal data).

### 3.6. They may have compliance issues

Not being compliant can result in legal and financial penalties. Compliance with legal and data security regulations is an essential requirement. When using a free application, you must act very carefully to comply with these legal regulations since you use these free applications in your private business, not as a private individual, but as a business person.

### 3.7. They may lack support and documentation

In the case of free software, their documentation may be inadequate, not up-to-date, or may not exist at all. The level of product support usually does not reach the level of paid software, and it may also happen that there is no help desk and the creator/s of the software is not reachable at any channel.

Accordingly, getting to know the free program may take longer than a paid one when you can watch well-thought-out, well-edited manuals and videos about paid applications.

A knowledgebase maintained and regularly updated on an official website can be very useful for learning a specific application, speeding up your familiarisation with the given program (shortening the learning curve), and making your work more efficient in the long run.

It is also important to emphasise that even if you use the free version of a trusted app, it usually comes with limited features and functions, so you cannot use it for business purposes.

### 3.8. They may have ‘Loss of interest’ issues

It is somewhat related to the previous aspect when it was already mentioned that in the case of specific free software, their documentation or support may not exist. In addition, it may also happen in the case of free programs that the developers stop updating and developing the given application.

It should not be forgotten that developers often do not work for a specific company. Instead, they develop a free application for fun, dedication, belonging to a specific group, or for their entertainment.

## 4. What can you do to protect yourself?

### 4.1. Search for and collect information about the application

The official site of the application is the best source of information. Get to know the application as much as possible and find out if it is the best possible choice to solve your problem.

### 4.2. Check what the application is requesting access to

If the installation process of the application is not clear to you, or if it asks for permissions that you do not need (or you do not know what they apply to), do not install the program, as there is a risk that another program may be installed without your knowledge, which then you can make unpredictable changes to your machine.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_c2cec4138dc7cb38c31623edcf0cf075.png)

It is worth checking the permissions in the settings and data protection to make sure which applications can access your data. Check the app’s settings to ensure no one can access your location or personal information without your knowledge or consent.

### 4.3. Search for reviews about the app

You need a tool to solve a specific problem when looking for an application. During the online search, you can see which applications are available, which websites you can download them from (the websites themselves can reveal a lot about the reliability of the given application), and last but not least, you can also read opinions about the applications.

### 4.4. Compare the application with competitors

List possible applications, then compare and narrow down the apps.

### 4.5. Download applications only from authentic and legitimate sites

If you have selected the app you want to use, find the official site of it and download it from there. 

### 4.6.  Read the terms and conditions

It may sound cliche, but read the general terms and conditions. And though this is almost impossible to follow because nobody has time to read tens or even hundreds of pages before clicking the download button, it is still worth it.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_12158ba5fd1117fa61732bf9ab9aafda.png)

Also, do not sign up for free trials without reading the fine print. When downloading a trial version, it may happen that your credit card has already been authorised for debiting, and the software you are using is still free; a certain amount has already been set aside and taken from your card.

### 4.7. Delete unnecessary apps

On your computer or mobile phone, you can see what applications are installed, when they were last used, or how often you use them. Delete applications you rarely use or have not used for a long time from your computer.

### 4.8. Delete suspicious apps

If an application asks for too many permissions or requests access to functions you do not want to consent to, delete the application.

### 4.9. Monitor your device

Monitor the operation of your device and occasionally run antivirus or device health testing applications. Be especially careful after downloading a new application: if you experience any strange or unusual behaviour (slowdown, unwanted pop-up ads, etc.), look for the cause (test if uninstalling the app eliminates the strange behaviour).

### 4.10. Separate work from entertainment

If possible, separate work from entertainment: do not use a device used for entertainment for work and vice versa, and do not store personal or valuable data on the ‘entertainment device’ so that your data cannot be misused.

### 4.11. Two things that must go without saying

Last but not least, there are two additional things you must always do: always update the apps and make sure that you have an antivirus installed on your machine.

## 5.	Free apps versus paid apps

### 5.1. Why is an app free?

We could rightly ask why an application is free. The answer to this question is not as simple as it seems initially because there can be many reasons for this.

Some applications are free because they use a marketing model, the basis of which is to encourage the user to make in-app purchases, and from these purchases, they support themselves and make a profit.

These applications benefit from advertising, but from the user’s point of view, randomly or constantly appearing ads are annoying and often unpleasant.

### 5.2. Data privacy

And here again, it is worth mentioning privacy and personal data protection. Because if you use any application, you enter into a contract with the creator or distributor of the application, and based on the contract, they can collect specific personal data about you (name, address, or even age, etc.). 

This type of data can also serve the purpose of bombarding you with targeted advertisements, among other things. We have all been faced with the fact that we searched for a specific product (e.g. on Google), and then, strangely, ads similar to the product appeared in the browser.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_10b9c86e665f0dc564b45eedcd0856cb.png)

Privacy is an aspect of data security that focuses on managing personal data: its collection, storage and sharing with third parties. In addition to these, it also deals with consent and regulatory compliance.

According to a report prepared by [Incognito](https://incogni.com/) researchers in September 2022, [55% of the applications](https://venturebeat.com/security/report-55-of-apps-available-on-google-play-share-user-data/) on Google Play share user data. Of the apps that share user data, free apps are, on average, seven times more likely to do so than their paid counterparts.

Free apps can post your personal information online without your consent or knowledge. This is a huge source of danger, as it is a direct threat to your privacy. A free application might access your personal data (email address, telephone number, postal address, work data, credit card number, etc.). They can then post this information online for anyone to see. 

### 5.3. Can apps steal data without permission?

That would obviously be illegal. What usually happens is that users give this permission themselves if they do not read the fine print and click ‘I agree’ without knowing what they are signing up for. So, by downloading free apps, you practically trade your personal data in exchange for free services.

## 6. Dangerous free mobile applications

Mobile apps, especially free ones, are risky because your smartphone is more vulnerable to security threats than your desktop computer. Therefore, phones are more commonly hacked, and hackers exploit users’ personal data.

Since your smartphone is very vulnerable to malicious apps, and even the most popular apps may not be completely safe, you should be very careful about the security of your data. Below are some basic precautions vital for any smartphone user downloading apps.

Even though app stores have verification procedures and constantly monitor apps, with the vast number of new apps being released every day, it is impossible to completely prevent apps infected with malware from appearing.

Apple’s App Store and Google Play Store do not scan ads for malware, meaning ads may redirect you to harmful websites or contain viruses. Also, some free apps are too invasive of your privacy. These include many popular social media applications (Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Instagram, …). These apps require access to most of your phone’s data: location, gallery, contacts, camera, texts, call logs, and storage.

It is up to you to ensure that the application you want to install is safe. Look for the application on the net, visit its official website and read (not only on the official site) users’ reviews. Also, always download the app from the official website and never use third parties to download apps. Be sure to read the list of permissions.

## 7. The practice and dangers of BYOD

Nowadays, BYOD ([Bring Your Own Device](https://www.cybersecurity.lu/tool/mobile-devices--bring-your-own-device-byod)) is very common, during which employees bring their mobile devices and laptops to the workplace (if they are not working from home or remotely).

One of the most significant disadvantages of this way of working is that employees mix personal and company data (and applications!) on the same device (which they use both as a work tool and for their own entertainment). Thus, applications that may not be allowed in a workplace environment can be installed on the same machine. 

One of the golden rules is not to use a company device for home use and not to mix company and personal or family use. This poses a considerable cybersecurity challenge for organisations.

## 8. Cookies and their functions

Cookies are data packets that Internet servers send to browsers. Their use is most useful when you visit certain websites several times (often). So that you do not have to download the given website and enter the settings again, the data stored in cookies speeds up the process of loading the page. However, they can also be used by web browsers and websites to track and collect information about your online activities and sell it to other companies.

The information that software and applications ‘collect’ from devices may differ, but they generally contain similar elements: web browsers like to track people’s shopping habits and interests. They then share this information with other companies to show you related ads that may interest you.

If the free app you downloaded can display ads that make you want to buy something, then the companies can make a profit. However, more sensitive data can be compromised: your full name, age, location, address, and place of employment.

It may not be a big problem for many, but if you consider it more, you realise they can seriously abuse this data. This thing does not stop here: through many applications, they collect bits of information about you, which they put together like pieces of a puzzle and store more and more bits and pieces of data in their database to create a profile about you.

## 9. Dangers of using free apps in business

When choosing software as a sole trader or business owner, it is imperative to do so carefully. Even if the company is a one-person company, during a data breach, the data of the company’s customers can fall into unwanted hands, and precious company data can be misused.

And in the case of a multi-person company, the data of the employees can also become public because of poorly chosen free software. In addition to possible IT damage, data leaks can also mean incalculable reputational damage.

In the case of business use, different expectations and ways of use occur for applications. Free software can be beneficial in terms of cost reduction. But for businesses, free software can cause compatibility issues with other programs, making communicating and performing other daily tasks difficult.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_5a4e4cc2d1446650d22582b9973fdd3d.png)

Free apps usually do not have any guarantee that they are safe from bugs. This can lead to the loss of sensitive customer and/or business data, which can directly and negatively affect your company’s reputation and level of professionalism.

A significant group of free applications is called ‘open source’ software. Open-source software can be freely used, copied, distributed, studied and modified. Its importance in IT is increasing, and the Internet is powered by open-source software: many of us use applications that we do not know open source daily.

The [MySQL database manager](https://www.mysql.com/), the popular [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) content management systems, and even the [PHP](https://www.php.net/) programming language are open source. The [Android operating system](https://www.android.com/), [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browsers, and the [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (formerly OpenOffice.org) office suite are also open source.

Below, in the example of markdown editors, you can see what aspects should be taken into account and what dangers are hidden by free online applications.

### 9.1. The original dilemma: online or offline?

Before creating any content using an online application, ask yourself whether you would share your content with the whole world without remorse or concern. Some online markdown editors analyse the text you create and use it to make targeted advertisements.

The phenomenon is not new. Perhaps one of the most glaring examples is Google Ads, which interestingly bombards us with advertisements corresponding to our search (in addition to taking geographical and other factors (often age, gender, and interests) into account).

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_8924f40fba450e782ab18ebe86b5f8c7.png)

Most applications collect data about us and use this data to profile us: where we log in, what device we use to log in, what we do in the application, what pages we visit, etc. These data can be of great value to companies or even individuals (e.g. hackers), as they can use them for marketing and other purposes.

For online use, we work on another computer in the cloud. The main concern about cloud computing is its security. The problem is that cloud providers are also prime targets for hackers, given the large amount of data they hold.

### 9.2. Are data breaches a real threat?

Suppose company data is published publicly on the Internet using a markdown editor. In that case, there is a chance that this data will be misused: information related to the company’s know-how, strategic objectives or confidential company data might fall into the hands of competitors.

A data leak can devastate a company’s reputation and may cause a much more significant financial loss than technical damage. And while companies and their reputation and customer loyalty are continuously tested, they are also threatened with severe fines and lawsuits simultaneously (because of the GDPR).

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_ed6a4b90d0613a473ef59672e9635a1e.png)

On the other hand, it is also possible that leaked company data and the accompanying publicity benefit a given company. Because of a scandal, the name of the given company might appear on the front page of well-known newspapers. Suppose the leaked data is unimportant or unrelated to the company’s core business. In that case, this can help a previously anonymous company to get into the spotlight.

This way or the other, a company should become in the spotlight by making its name known through exemplary service, good products and reliability.

###  9.3. Can a text editor be hacked?

For an attack to be successful, an attacker must somehow gain access to a legitimate user account through [phishing](https://www.cybersecurity.lu/tool/phishing-the-most-common-cyberthreat-and-the-everlasting-fight-against-it), [social engineering](https://www.cybersecurity.lu/tool/social-engineering-the-art-of-manipulating-people), or other methods.
Some text editors allow users to run third-party code and use plugins to extend the application’s functionality. While this may benefit the users, some [experts say](https://www.securityweek.com/hackers-can-abuse-text-editors-privilege-escalation) it can pose security risks.

![](http://hdoc.csirt-tooling.org/uploads/upload_8c987265ee30c2806e3a5c6507fc4d88.png)

Text editors can be hacked via third-party plugins – [ThreatPost](https://threatpost.com/researchers-show-how-popular-text-editors-can-be-attacked-via-third-party-plugins/130559/)

“Depending on the targeted editor, the attacker needs to create specially crafted scripts or package files, and place them in specific plugin directories. In some cases, the hacker may need to create additional files and enable extensions in order for the attack to work, but this should not be difficult if they have access to a less-privileged account.” – [Eduard Kovacs](https://www.securityweek.com/hackers-can-abuse-text-editors-privilege-escalation)

## 10. Conclusion

There are many dangers in downloading and using free apps. Be aware of what you are downloading and learn about the app before installing it on your device. Do not install unknown apps, and always read app permissions. If you are unsatisfied with the permissions, do not install the app.

Open-source (and other free) software allows small businesses to perform daily tasks at little or no cost. Saving money helps optimise growth and efficiency throughout the company. However, in addition to the undeniable advantages, the entrepreneur sometimes faces increased cybersecurity risks when using free applications. 

Therefore, free apps must be used carefully and only downloaded from their official website. In addition,  download only software that many users have commented on positively.

Therefore, free applications require enhanced cybersecurity hygiene: this software should be used with increased caution.
